// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility that Flutter provides. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

void main() {
  // var routerConfig = MyRouterConfig(authRouteGuard: AuthRouteGuard());
  // var matcher = (routerConfig.root as RouterNode).matcher;
  // print(matcher.match('/users/1/posts'));
